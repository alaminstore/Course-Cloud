                The following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions,

                Generally speaking, every Privacy Policy agreement should have

              <p>
                We are committed to protecting your privacy. Authorized
                employees within the company on a need to know basis only use
                any information collected from individual customers. We
                constantly review our systems and data to ensure the best
                possible service to our customers. Parliament has created
                specific offences for unauthorised actions against computer
                systems and data. We will investigate any such actions with a
                view to prosecuting and/or taking civil proceedings to recover

                We are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and as
                such, any information concerning the Client and their respective
                Client Records may be passed to third parties. However, Client
                records are regarded as confidential and therefore will not be
                divulged to any third party, other than{" "}

                if legally required to do so to the appropriate authorities.
                Clients have the right to request sight of, and copies of any
                and all Client Records we keep, on the proviso that we are given
                reasonable notice of such a request. Clients are requested to
                retain copies of any literature issued in relation to the
                provision of our services. Where appropriate, we shall issue
                Client’s with appropriate written information, handouts or
                copies of records as part of an agreed contract, for the benefit
                of both parties.

                <h5>Payment</h5>
                <p>
                  Cash or Personal Cheque with Bankers Card, all major
                  Credit/Debit Cards, Bankers Draft or BACS Transfer are all
                  acceptable methods of payment. Our Terms are payment in full
                  within thirty days. All goods remain the property of the
                  Company until paid for in full. Monies that remains
                  outstanding by the due date will incur late payment interest
                  at the rate of 2% above the prevailing Bank of England's base
                  rate on the outstanding balance until such time as the balance
                  is paid in full and final settlement. We reserve the right to
                  seek recovery of any monies remaining unpaid sixty days from
                  the date of invoice via collection Agencies and/or through the
                  Small Claims Court in the event that the outstanding balance
                  does not exceed £3000. In such circumstances, you shall be
                  liable for any and all additional administrative and/or court
                  costs.{" "}
                  <span style={{ color: "red" }}>[Amend as appropriate]</span>{" "}
                  Returned cheques will incur a £25 charge to cover banking fees
                  and administrative costs. In an instance of a second Returned
                  cheque, we reserve the right to terminate the arrangement and,
                  if agreed to, we shall insist on future cash transactions
                  only. Consequently, all bookings and/or transactions and
                  agreements entered into will cease with immediate effect until
                  such time as any and all outstanding monies are recovered in
                  full.

                  (including, but not limited to the exclusions and limitations
                  set out above), then the invalid or unenforceable provision
                  will be severed from these terms and the remaining terms will
